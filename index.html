                    <h2>About S&G Carpet Cleaners</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Paul. The story of S & G Carpet Cleaners is a simple one. After years of working at the
                        corporate
                        grind as Director of Operations I decided to go into business for myself. The lessons that I
                        learned
                        along the way, be on time, be fair, deliver consistent quality and deliver more than you
                        promised, I
                        wanted to carry through to my own business. So after ten years in the Carpet Cleaning business
                        you
                        can
                        rest assured that I'll be here year after year to service your Carpets . S&G is not a here today
                        gone
                        tomorrow business.

                        Call me at (704) 266-2214 to discuss your carpet cleaning needs. Whether it is a few rooms in
                        your
                        home,
                        Your office, an apartment complex or hotel rooms, you can be assured that we will respond
                        quickly to
                        get
                        your carpets looking cleaner and smelling fresher.</p>
                    <h2>We save so you can save</h2>
                    <p>As a local family owned business we don't have to pay franchise fees and for national advertising
                        that
                        only increase costs that we have to pass along to you. The big companies have offices, company
                        trucks,
                        royalties and lots of advertising that only add to the cost that you have to pay for. Our low
                        overhead
                        is passed on to you so you get the same or greater quality of service at a far lower cost.</p>
                    <h2>Value</h2>
                    <p>Pride, care, dedication, and attention to detail. I take this seriously and strive to work
                        harder,
                        respond faster and take more care than a large impersonal company. My family depends on the
                        quality
                        work
                        that I do for you. If I let you down, I let them down, so you can be confident that I will do
                        the
                        best
                        job possible for you.</p>
                    <h2>Guarantee</h2>
                    <p>Our gaurantee is simple. If you are not happy, we are not happy. I take this seriously and strive
                        to
                        work
                        harder, to respond faster and take more cae than a large impersonal company. We want your repeat
                        business and referrals so if you are not happy with the results we won't get either. </p>
                    <h2>Equipment</h2>
                    <p>To best serve you we have invested in three seperate types of carpet cleaning equipment.The truck
                        mounted
                        high pressure wsteam extractor equipment. The Dry Cleaning equipment that leaves your carpet
                        clean
                        and
                        dry immediatly after cleaning. And the portable high pressure that we can use where the truck
                        mounted
                        hoses will not reach. </p>
